        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>"Hi! I'm Ashley Nadine J. Pairat, a 2nd-year IT student at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines. 
            I have a strong interest in technology and problem-solving, always eager to expand my knowledge in the field of IT. In my free time, I enjoy playing online games,
             which have helped me develop strategic thinking and teamwork skills. I also have experience in video and photo editingâ€”while I don't consider myself an expert, 
             I love being creative and continuously improving my work. I'm always open to learning new things and taking on challenges that help me grow."</p>
